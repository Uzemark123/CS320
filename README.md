How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security, I apply thorough testing techniques, including unit tests, boundary tests, and security assessments, such as input validation and error handling.
Additionally, I follow secure coding practices and review dependencies regularly to minimize vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by thoroughly reviewing requirements and, when possible, collaborating with users or stakeholders. 
This approach allows me to design features and interfaces that align with user expectations and enhance overall usability.

How do I approach designing software?
My software design approach starts with clear, goal-oriented planning, breaking down the program into well-defined, modular components.
I focus on creating clean, maintainable code that can be adapted and scaled as requirements evolve.
